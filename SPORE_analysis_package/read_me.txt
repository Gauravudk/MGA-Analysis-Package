This read-me file contains instructions on how to use the clustering tool.

1. Go through all demo files to check the suitable format.
2. Make sure your input files are in the same format as the demo files.
3. Save your file with the same name as demo files without "-demo" .
4. Run gini.py file first to create gini.csv file.
5. Then, run the clustering.ipynb file to create the clusters.

Notes: 
1. In the CSV file, net_installed_capacity and installed_capacity include all the critical
technologies in the system. 
2. On the other hand, the display_parameters folder contains files specific to the technology
where one should include all the parameter which affects specific technology most from the
user's point of view. 
3. Installed capacities are used to make the clusters, and display parameters are used 
to check the quality of clusters.
 
Thank you for using the tool.
